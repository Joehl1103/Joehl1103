## Who am I?

* I am a seasoned post-sales Operations Specialist who fell in love with coding.
* I love to think about systems and how to make them more efficient. I see code as the best way to do this. It gives us flexibility, precision, and safety.
* I am transitioning from a data-heavy Operations role where I wrote lots of SQL,and node.js, and thought a lot about efficient workflows, to a developer role.
* I started with Python and Java, and soon got joyfully sucked into the JS ecosystem.
* I have complete the core parts of the [Full Stack Open Course](https://fullstackopen.com/en/) and am working on finishing up the extra modules.
* I love experimenting with AI and am learning full agentic workflows to increase productivity.
* I love to learn, excellence, and craftsmanship.
